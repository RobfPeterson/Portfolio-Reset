I recently put together a fairly basic portfolio. However, I decided to upgrade to a more modern tech stack using Next.JS. I also wanted to improve the clearness to make it easier to understand my skill set and past experience. 

Thank you to [tedawf](https://github.com/tedawf) for the portfolio template.
