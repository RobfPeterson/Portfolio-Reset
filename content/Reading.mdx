Past Favorites, ranked in order:

Past Favorites, ranked in order:
1. *The Power Broker*, by Robert A. Caro
     + Closest book I have found to completely summarizing a person's life. The depth of research and vividness of Caro's description is astounding. 
2. *Nudge: The Final Edition*, by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein
3. *Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction*, by Philip E. Tetlock and Dan Gardner
4. *An Army at Dawn*, by Rick Atkinson
5. *Algorithms to Live by*, by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths
6. *Why Nations Fail*, by Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson 
7. *Poor Charlie's Almanack*, by Charlie Munger
     + One of the most insightful books on turning small, systematic methods of thinking into decisions and then impact. 
8. *Thus Spake Zarathustra*, by Friedrich Nietzsche
     + I was recommend this by a high school friend who thinks more about philosophy. It was a facsinating read over winter break, and reframes living life into making one you would want to live eternally. 
9. *Guns, Germs, and Steel*, by Jared Diamond.
10. *The Undercover Economist*, by Tim Harford
     + Solid primer to microeconomics. Not textbook level depth, but more readable. 
11. *Thinking in Systems*, by Donella Meadows
12. Psychopolitics, by Byung-Chul Han 
13. *Breakneck*, by Dan Wang
     + Interesting read which examines the differences in social systems between the US and China. One major point which I don't think this book gives enough attention is the increasing cost between manufacturing a hardware prototype and software due to the loss of US manufacturing. This reframed my perspective on why US financial and VC cultures have shifted away from physical startups. One start up I had the opportunity to vist on a career trek, [Newlab](https://www.newlab.com), is a facsinating way to addressing this. 
14. *Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.*, by Ron Chernow
15. *The Day of Battle*, by Rick Atkinson
16. *Freakonomics*, by Stephen J. Dubner and Steven Levitt
17. *End Times*, by Peter Turchin
18. *The Guns at Last Light: The War in Western Europe*, by Rick Atkinson
19. *VC: An American History*, by Tom Nicholas
20. *The World For Sale: Money, Power, and the Traders Who Barter the Earth's Resources*, by Javier Blas and Jack Farchy
21. *The 48 Laws of Power*, by Robert Greene
