I recently put together a fairly basic portfolio. However, I decided to upgrade to a more modern tech stack using Next.JS. I also wanted to improve the clearness to make it easier to understand my skill set and past experience. 

Overtime, I will be posting code snippets, analytical models, and my thoughts on my latest reading, as well as tracking my academic and professional progress. If I decide to develop more frontend skills, then I will likely modify this site and improve it. 

Thank you to [tedawf](https://github.com/tedawf) for the portfolio template.
